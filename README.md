# Three.js Journey Course Repo

This repository contains all the files and projects I've developed while following the online course on [threejs-journey.com](https://threejs-journey.com).

## About the Course

Three.js Journey is an extensive online course that helps learners master Three.js, a powerful JavaScript library used for creating 3D graphics on the web. The course offers in-depth lessons and hands-on projects, providing the practical experience needed to leverage Three.js effectively.

## Repository Structure

Each project or lesson in this course has its own directory. The directories are numbered and named according to the order and the topics of the lessons in the course. For example, `03-basic-scene` or `04-local-server`.

Inside each directory, you will find all the assets and files needed to run that particular lesson's project.

## Running the Projects

To run a project, navigate to the project's directory and install the dependencies using `npm install`. Then, run the project using `npm run dev`.
