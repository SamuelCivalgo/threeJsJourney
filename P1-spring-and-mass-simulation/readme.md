# Three.js Spring and Mass Simulation

## Description

This simulation models a spring-mass system using Three.js and draws inspiration from Xavier Provencal's course at ETS Montreal, titled "GTI320 Mathematical Programming: Patterns and Efficient Algorithms" (https://www.etsmtl.ca/etudes/cours/gti320).

It incorporates fundamental physics principles such as Hooke's Law and Newton's Second Law, and employs Euler's method for numerical integration, along with a Gauss-Seidel solver.

Additionally, some aspects of the code were inspired by the Three.js course available at https://threejs-journey.com/.
